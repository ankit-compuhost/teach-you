      <td>Jammu authorities launch aptitude test for students of government schools</td>
      <td>The Directorate of School Education Jammu (DSEJ) has launched the Tamanna aptitude test for students of government schools in the region to help them make appropriate academic choices and career-related decisions, officials said on Wednesday. The DSEJ initiated the aptitude testing process from Tuesday, School Education Jammu Director Anuradha Gupta told reporters here. "To begin with, the Counselling Cell of the DSEJ conducted two days online orientation cum training programme of faculty counsellors of Jammu division from winter zone, in which 500 faculty counsellors and psychological task force members were trained for conducting the test on the students," she said. More such training sessions will be conducted before the actual test, which will be in offline mode, Gupta said. The 'Tamanna' (Try and Measure Aptitude and Natural Abilities) test has been developed for senior school students by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), New Delhi, under the aegis of the Union Ministry of Education. "The test contains items on seven dimensions measured in aptitude testing i.e., Language Aptitude (LA), Abstract Reasoning (AR), Verbal Reasoning (VR), Mechanical Reasoning (MR), Numerical Reasoning (NA), Spatial Aptitude (SA), and Perceptual Aptitude (PA), along with technical manual thereby, helping the students of Class 9 and 10 make a better choice of subjects," she said. The official said the DSEJ has taken the lead by being the first body to help students take the benefit of this test. As the test is in its initial phase, the Counselling Cell has been asked to make proper reports after conducting the test so as to give necessary inputs to the agency concerned for its further standardisation if required, she said. Winter zone schools are opening from March 1 and capacity-development of teachers is being done to mentor and guide the students. "In the new session, this test will be used as a tool to facilitate students for self-awareness, academic choice making and understanding their aptitude for career decision making. It is to add that pilot testing of this test was successfully conducted in all the 11 zones of Udhampur district," the director said. Speaking at the successful completion of the two-day programme, DSEJ Counselling Cell head Romesh Sharma advised faculty counsellors to use the test as a complimentary tool for exploring and understanding the abilities of the students.</td>

      <td>No offline exams up to Class 8 in Delhi govt schools, students to be graded on assignments</td>
      <td>Students from Class 3 to 8 of Delhi government and government-aided schools will not have to sit for offline exams and will instead be graded on the basis of projects and assignments, the Delhi government said Wednesday. The government has issued guidelines in this regard, which are applicable for the 2020-21 academic session, when schools were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and all teaching and learning activities were conducted online. "Since no classroom teaching and learning has taken place at the primary and middle level, the formal mode of pen and paper assessment will be replaced by a subject wise assessment of projects and assignments for Classes 3 to 8," said Rita Sharma, Additional Director of Education, Delhi. Schools were reopened in Delhi for students of Class 9 and Class 11 on February 5. For classes 10 and 12, classes had resumed on January 18 in light of the board exams. According to the guidelines, for Classes 3 to 5, 30 marks will be for assessment based on worksheets, 30 for the assignments given in winter breaks and 40 marks for the assignments and projects provided from March 1 to 15. Similarly, for Classes 6 to 8, 20 marks will be for assessment based on worksheets, 30 for the assignments given in winter breaks and 50 marks for the assignments and projects provided from March 1 to 15. "In case a student does not have access to a digital device or internet, the assignments and projects will be given in hard copies by calling his parents to the school while following the COVID-19 guidelines," the guidelines state. In a separate circular Wednesday, the Delhi government said students from classes KG to 2 will be assessed in the month of March based on assignments given during the winter break and "responses to online/ offline worksheets shared with the students during COVID- 19 Pandemic through digital modes/ WhatsApp/ in person by the parents/ guardians". "All the currently enrolled students of classes Nursery to II shall be promoted to the next class in the Academic Session 2021-22. However, the purpose of this assessment is to understand the impact of alternate learning approach that needed to be adopted under the prevailing circumstances this year," DDE (Primary) Harsh Arya said.</td>
